        <h4>Celebrating 40 Years!<br>1978 - 2018</h4>
        <p>
            Joe's Place is more than just pizza and pasta - the Farruggio family has a rich history. Hailing Agrigento,
            Italy before coming to the United States, the Farruggio's brought their Italian heritage and love of
            authentic Sicilian flavors with them. The family's first restaurant opened in 1978. Today, they continue to
            bring an authentic Italian experience to Arlington. Read on to learn more about the history of Joe's from
            Joe himself - and join the family as they celebrate 40 years of success: thank you!
        </p>
        <h4>The History of Joe's by Joe Farruggio</h4>
        <h5>History in the Making</h5>
        <p>
            Farruggio familyIn 1970, my family and I left our Sicilian home town of Agrigento, Italy and settled in New
            York to pursue the American dream. With little money and hard work, we learned the art of making New
            York-style pizza.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, we confirmed that America truly is the land of opportunity when we moved to Virginia and opened the
            first Joe's Place in Bailey's Crossroads in 1978. With ongoing success, we opened additional restaurants,
            and in 2007 consolidated our operations in the Arlington and Vienna locations so that our family members
            could remain closely involved at each restaurant, and ensure the superior customer service we proudly
            provide each day.
        </p>
        <h5>The Joe's You Know Today</h5>
        <p>
            Over time, we've developed a reputation for the best pizza in town, along with a warm, friendly atmosphere
            and strong support for the community. Many of Joe's staff have been with us for 10, 20, even 30 years. They
            and our many longtime regular customers truly are like family.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most importantly, we continue to make all of our own Sicilian style pasta dishes, sauces, pizza and desserts
            with recipes we brought from Italy, and through all we have learned in this great country. Our food is
            prepared with love and care to be healthful, zesty and delicious.
        </p>
        <h5>From the Joe's Family</h5>
        <p>
            Our entire family, made up of myself and my sons Roberto, Enrico and Alessandro; his wife Rosa and children
